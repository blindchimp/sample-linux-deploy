CDC-X is an online audio/video live call and messaging system.

This just contains a minimal set of files needed by CDC-X 
on Linux. Simply symlink to your cdcx executable, and run it
with the CWD in this directory (and optionally set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
if your system does not have a Qt4 installation.)

It is here for testing, as you normally would not install the
program as a normal end-user deployment while testing it.
